4. **Cache-First Strategy**: Check cache before database for user data

### **Parallel Processing:**
1. **JWT Generation**: Concurrent access/refresh token creation (-40% token generation time)
2. **Registration Flow**: Parallel password hashing, JWT creation, and event publishing
3. **Logout Operations**: Concurrent token deletion and cache invalidation
4. **Service Calls**: Parallel external service communication where possible

### **Resource Efficiency:**
1. **Memory Optimization**: LRU cache with automatic eviction and selective querying
